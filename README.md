## A new program that creates unique colormap effects on .mp4 files

This program has has options for contrast & brightness sliders, a button to turn on and off the infrared effect, and various options to choose different colormaps
(Warning it is somehwat unfinished and buggy when using the exe file which will be down below) But I am releasing all of the code and files associated with the project

P.S. This was originally supposed to be an After Effects plugin
